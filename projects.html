	<p>Senior Development Project</p>
	<ul style="font-size: .65em">
		<li>On a team of 5, we were paired with a company to develop a full stack scheduling application.</li>
		<li>Developed for and hosted on a LAMP stack, the app takes in a set of unavailability times by 2 kinds of users, bus drivers and host congregations.</li>
		<li>Once unavailabilities have been submitted by all users, the back-end will run a custom algorithm to create a schedule within the spec of business rules approved by the customer. This schedule is then viewable by their respective users, and admins.</li>

	<ul style="font-size: .65em">
		<li>Written in Java</li>
		<li>This was a quick exercise I did to try and efficiently reverse words/sentences</li>
		<li><b>wordFlip()</b> method will reverse the order of each word in a sentence but each word is still readable forwards.</li>
		<li><b>Input:</b> This is a sentence<b> Output: </b>sentence a is This</li>
		<li><b>fullReverse()</b> method will reverse the word structure as well as order of each word in a sentence.</li>
		<li><b>Input:</b> This is a sentence<b> Output: </b>ecnetnes a si sihT</li>
		<li>Both of these methods have a consistent runtime of under .009 seconds, running consecutively.</li>

	<p>Instagram Like Bot</p>
	<ul style="font-size: .65em">
		<li>Written in javascript, developed for an Instagram influencer.</li>
		<li>The code likes a certain number of posts based on an integer set by the user. After finding the heart (like) element within the HTML, it will like a post on whatever feed is loaded on the page. It will then generate a random wait time between 0 and 5 seconds. This value may also be modified. This will iterate until the user-set integer has been reached. </li>
